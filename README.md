# Face-to-Race: Predicting Race from Facial Images

This project explores the challenging and ethically complex task of race prediction from facial images using a deep learning model trained in Python. It is **crucial** to understand that race is a social construct, not a biological reality, and attempting to predict it from images is fraught with potential for bias and misuse.  This project serves as a technical exploration and **should not** be used in any real-world application that could have discriminatory consequences. It is intended for research and educational purposes only. The potential for harm is significant, and responsible development practices are paramount.

## Introduction

This project investigates the technical aspects of race prediction from facial images. While the ability to categorize faces by race might seem technically feasible, it's vital to acknowledge the profound ethical implications. This model is *not* intended for deployment in any real-world scenario. Its purpose is strictly limited to research and educational exploration of the challenges and potential pitfalls associated with this type of analysis.  We strongly discourage any use of this model for anything other than careful, ethical study.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the FairFace dataset. This dataset contains images of faces labeled with 7 racial categories: Black, Indian, Southeast Asian, East Asian, Latino/Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and White.

**Important:** Due to ethical concerns and the potential for misuse, the dataset itself will not be made publicly available. Researchers interested in this area should obtain the FairFace dataset independently. I understand the limitations this may place on reproducibility; however, I believe it is the most ethical course of action.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on CNN. The model was trained using FastAI.
